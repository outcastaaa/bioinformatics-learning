Number of cores to be used: 4
Output path specified as: /mnt/d/methylation/output/extracting_results/


Summarising bedGraph parameters:
===============================================================
Generating additional output in bedGraph and coverage format
bedGraph format:        <Chromosome> <Start Position> <End Position> <Methylation Percentage>
coverage format:        <Chromosome> <Start Position> <End Position> <Methylation Percentage> <count methylated> <count non-methylated>

Now reading in and storing sequence information of the genome specified in: /mnt/d/methylation/data/gene/

chr 19 (61420004 bp)

Stored sequence information of 1 chromosomes/scaffolds in total

==============================================================================
Methylation information will now be written into a genome-wide cytosine report

>>> Writing genome-wide cytosine report to: SRR7368845_trimmed_bismark_bt2.deduplicated.CpG_report.txt.gz <<<

Storing all covered cytosine positions for chromosome: 19
Writing cytosine report for last chromosome 19 (stored 872318 different covered positions)
Finished writing out cytosine report for covered chromosomes (processed 1 chromosomes/scaffolds in total)

Now processing chromosomes that were not covered by any methylation calls in the coverage file...
All chromosomes in the genome were covered by at least some reads. coverage2cytosine processing complete.
