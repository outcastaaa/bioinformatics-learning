Path to Bowtie 2 specified as: bowtie2
Bowtie seems to be working fine (tested command 'bowtie2 --version' [2.3.5])
Output format is BAM (default)
Alignments will be written out in BAM format. Samtools found here: '/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/samtools'
Reference genome folder provided is /mnt/d/methylation/data/gene/       (absolute path is '/mnt/d/methylation/data/gene/)'
FastQ format assumed (by default)

Input files to be analysed (in current folder '/mnt/d/methylation/output/adapter'):
./SRR7368841_trimmed.fq.gz
./SRR7368842_trimmed.fq.gz
./SRR7368845_trimmed.fq.gz
Library is assumed to be strand-specific (directional), alignments to strands complementary to the original top or bottom strands will be ignored (i.e. not performed!)
Output will be written into the directory: /mnt/d/methylation/output/bismark_align_results/
Running Bismark Parallel version. Number of parallel instances to be spawned: 4

Current working directory is: /mnt/d/methylation/output/adapter

Now reading in and storing sequence information of the genome specified in: /mnt/d/methylation/data/gene/
