Bismark report for: ./SRR7368842_trimmed.fq.gz (version: v0.19.1)
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /mnt/d/methylation/data/gene/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	184620355
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	5184075
Mapping efficiency:	2.8%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	173722868
Sequences did not map uniquely:	5713412
