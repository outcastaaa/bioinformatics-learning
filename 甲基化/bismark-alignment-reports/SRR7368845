Bismark report for: ./SRR7368845_trimmed.fq.gz (version: v0.19.1)
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /mnt/d/methylation/data/gene/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	101432035
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	2915591
Mapping efficiency:	2.9%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	95450686
Sequences did not map uniquely:	3065758
