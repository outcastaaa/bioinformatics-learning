Bismark report for: ./SRR7368841_trimmed.fq.gz (version: v0.19.1)
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /mnt/d/methylation/data/gene/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
