$ trim_galore -o /mnt/d/$ methylation/output/adapter/ --fastqc /mnt/d/methylation/data/sequence/*.fastq.gz
Multicore support not enabled. Proceeding with single-core trimming.
Path to Cutadapt set as: 'cutadapt' (default)
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')
Cutadapt version: 4.1
single-core operation.
No quality encoding type selected. Assuming that the data provided uses Sanger encoded Phred scores (default)

Output will be written into the directory: /mnt/d/methylation/output/adapter/


AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> /mnt/d/methylation/data/sequence/SRR7368841.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type    Count   Sequence        Sequences analysed      Percentage
Illumina        65577   AGATCGGAAGAGC   1000000 6.56
Nextera 1       CTGTCTCTTATA    1000000 0.00
smallRNA        0       TGGAATTCTCGG    1000000 0.00
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 65577). Second best hit was Nextera (count: 1)

SUMMARISING RUN PARAMETERS
==========================
Input filename: /mnt/d/methylation/data/sequence/SRR7368841.fastq.gz
Trimming mode: single-end
Trim Galore version: 0.6.8dev
Cutadapt version: 4.1
Number of cores used for trimming: 1
Quality Phred score cutoff: 20
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' (Illumina TruSeq, Sanger iPCR; auto-detected)
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length before a sequence gets removed: 20 bp
Running FastQC on the data once trimming has completed
Output file(s) will be GZIP compressed

Cutadapt seems to be fairly up-to-date (version 4.1). Setting -j 1
Writing final adapter and quality trimmed output to SRR7368841_trimmed.fq.gz
